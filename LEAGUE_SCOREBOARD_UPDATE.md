# League Scoreboard Update - Real Data Implementation

## Overview
Updated the `LeagueScoreboard.tsx` component to fetch and display real matchup data from the database instead of mock data. The page now automatically determines the current week based on the date and displays actual league matchups.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hook: `useWeeklyMatchups.ts`
Created a comprehensive hook for fetching weekly matchup data.

**Features:**
- `useWeeklyMatchups(leagueId, weekNumber)` - Fetches matchups for a specific week
- `useCurrentWeek(leagueId)` - Automatically determines the current week based on:
  - Current date
  - Fantasy season weeks schedule
  - Falls back to first scheduled matchup if no current week found

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface WeeklyMatchup {
  id: string;
  week_number: number;
  matchup_date: string;
  status: 'scheduled' | 'live' | 'completed';
  season_type: 'regular' | 'playoff' | 'championship';
  fantasy_team1_id: string;
  fantasy_team2_id: string;
  fantasy_team1_score: number | null;
  fantasy_team2_score: number | null;
  team1: { id, team_name, user_id, wins, losses };
  team2: { id, team_name, user_id, wins, losses };
}
```

### 3. Component Structure

```tsx

  For each matchup:
    - Team 1 (avatar, name, record, score, winner icon)
    - VS section (status, date)
    - Team 2 (avatar, name, record, score, winner icon)
    - Quick Stats:
      - Total Points
      - Point Differential

```

## Database Queries

**Fetch Matchups:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, week_number, matchup_date, status, season_type,
  fantasy_team1_id, fantasy_team2_id,
  fantasy_team1_score, fantasy_team2_score,
  team1:fantasy_teams!fantasy_team1_id(...),
  team2:fantasy_teams!fantasy_team2_id(...)
FROM weekly_matchups
WHERE league_id = ? AND week_number = ?
ORDER BY matchup_date ASC
```

**Determine Current Week:**
```sql
-- 1. Get league's season year
SELECT season_year FROM leagues WHERE id = ?

-- 2. Find current week from fantasy_season_weeks
SELECT week_number, start_date, end_date
FROM fantasy_season_weeks
WHERE season_year = ? AND CURRENT_DATE BETWEEN start_date AND end_date

-- 3. Fallback: Get first scheduled matchup
SELECT week_number FROM weekly_matchups
WHERE league_id = ? AND status = 'scheduled'
ORDER BY week_number ASC LIMIT 1
```
