# Salary Cap Draft Completion System

## Overview
This document describes how the draft manager handles teams that run out of cap space during the draft, ensuring the draft can complete even when teams have incomplete rosters.

## The Problem
In salary cap leagues, teams can mismanage their cap and reach a point where they:
1. Have less than $600,000 in remaining cap space (minimum NBA salary)
2. Cannot afford any remaining undrafted players

Without proper handling, this would cause the draft to stall indefinitely.

## The Solution

### Automatic Cap-Out Detection
The draft manager now checks before every pick:
1. **Does this team have at least $600,000 in cap space?**
2. **Are there any affordable undrafted players remaining?**

If either answer is NO, the team is "capped out" and cannot make selections.

### Pick Skipping
When a team is capped out:
- Their pick is automatically marked as completed
- The `auto_pick_reason` is set to `'insufficient_cap_space'`
- The draft immediately moves to the next pick
- No player is drafted for that pick

### Draft Completion
The draft completes when **either**:
1. All picks are completed (normal completion), OR
2. No teams can afford any remaining players (early completion)

This prevents infinite loops where the draft cycles through capped-out teams endlessly.

## Implementation Details

### New Functions

#### `canTeamAffordPlayers()`
```typescript
async function canTeamAffordPlayers(
  supabase: any, 
  leagueId: string, 
  teamId: string
): Promise<boolean>
```

**Checks:**
1. Team's current salary vs salary cap
2. Remaining cap space >= $600,000
3. Existence of any affordable undrafted players

**Returns:** `true` if team can make a pick, `false` if capped out

#### `canAnyTeamAffordPlayers()`
```typescript
async function canAnyTeamAffordPlayers(
  supabase: any, 
  leagueId: string
): Promise<boolean>
```

**Checks:** All teams in the league
**Returns:** `true` if at least one team can afford players

### Modified Functions

#### `moveToNextPick()`
Now includes three new checks:

1. **Global Cap Check** (after finding next pick):
```typescript
const anyTeamCanAfford = await canAnyTeamAffordPlayers(supabase, leagueId);
if (!anyTeamCanAfford) {
  await completeDraft(supabase, leagueId);
  return;
}
```

2. **Individual Team Check** (before setting timer):
```typescript
const canAfford = await canTeamAffordPlayers(supabase, leagueId, nextTeam.id);
if (!canAfford) {
  // Mark pick as skipped and recursively move to next
}
```

3. **Recursive Skip** (if team is capped out):
```typescript
await moveToNextPick(supabase, leagueId, { 
  ...draftState, 
  current_pick_number: nextPick.pick_number 
});
```

## Database Changes

### New `auto_pick_reason` Value
- **Value:** `'insufficient_cap_space'`
- **Meaning:** Team was skipped due to being over cap
- **Stored in:** `draft_order.auto_pick_reason`

### Existing Values
- `'autodraft_enabled'` - Team had autodraft on
- `'time_expired'` - Team's timer ran out
- `'no_eligible_players'` - No players available (rare)

## User Experience

### For Commissioners
- Draft completes automatically even with incomplete rosters
- No manual intervention required
- Clear logging of cap-related skips

### For Active Managers
- Must manage cap carefully throughout draft
- Can see when other teams are skipped in draft history
- Incentivizes strategic cap management

### For Auto-Drafted Teams
- Protected from cap-out during autodraft (algorithm stays under budget)
- Less likely to be penalized by cap constraints
- Algorithm uses remaining cap / remaining picks calculation

## Strategy & Balance

### Penalizing Mismanagement
Teams that actively manage their draft but mismanage cap:
- **Penalty:** Lose remaining picks when capped out
- **Impact:** Incomplete roster, competitive disadvantage
- **Fairness:** Self-inflicted penalty

### Protecting Autodraft Teams
Teams on autodraft for majority of draft:
- **Protection:** Algorithm prevents cap-out scenarios
- **Method:** Dynamic budget calculation per pick
- **Formula:** `average_budget = remaining_cap / picks_remaining`
- **Result:** Nearly impossible to cap out on autodraft

### Competitive Balance
- Rewards active managers who plan ahead
- Punishes reckless spending early in draft
- Maintains draft flow without manual intervention
- Allows drafts to complete in reasonable time

## Edge Cases Handled

### All Teams Capped Out
```
Round 10 of 15:
- Team A: $400k remaining (capped out)
- Team B: $550k remaining (capped out)
- Team C: $500k remaining (capped out)
- No affordable players remain

Result: Draft completes at end of Round 10
```

### Rotating Cap-Outs
```
Round 12:
- Pick 1: Team A capped out ‚Üí skipped
- Pick 2: Team B drafts successfully
- Pick 3: Team C capped out ‚Üí skipped
- Pick 4: Team D drafts successfully

Result: Draft continues with only B and D picking
```

### Single Team Remaining
```
Late rounds:
- All teams except one are capped out
- Remaining team continues picking alone
- Draft completes when they're capped or rounds end
```

### No Affordable Players Left
```
If all remaining players cost > $50M:
- Most teams capped out
- Even teams with $10M cap can't pick
- Draft completes early
```

## Logging & Monitoring

### Console Logs

#### Team Cap Check
```
üí∏ Team {teamId} is capped out (remaining: $0.45M)
```

#### Pick Skip
```
üí∏ Team "Lakers" is capped out - marking pick as skipped
```

#### Global Cap Check
```
üö´ No teams can afford any remaining players - ending draft
```

#### Draft Completion
```
üèÅ Draft completed for league {leagueId} - no teams can afford remaining players
```

### Database Tracking
All skipped picks are recorded with:
- `is_completed = true`
- `is_auto_picked = true`
- `auto_pick_reason = 'insufficient_cap_space'`
- `time_started` and `time_expires` timestamps

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Cap checks query only necessary data
- Uses indexes on `league_id`, `fantasy_team_id`
- Limits results to first affordable player
- Subquery for drafted players is efficient

### Recursion Safety
- Max recursion depth = number of teams
- Worst case: all teams skip in one round
- Terminates with global cap check
- No infinite loop risk

### API Call Frequency
- Only called when moving to next pick
- Not called during timer countdown
- Adds ~100-200ms per pick transition
- Negligible impact on draft speed

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Warning System**
   - Alert teams when cap space < $5M
   - Show "picks remaining" estimate
   - Highlight risky picks

2. **Cap Projection**
   - Show projected remaining cap after pick
   - Display "safe pick" threshold
   - Calculate max affordable salary

3. **Analytics**
   - Track cap-out frequency per league
   - Identify common cap mismanagement patterns
   - League-wide cap efficiency stats

4. **Flexibility Options**
   - Commissioner override for cap rules
   - Soft cap with luxury tax
   - Mid-draft cap increases

## Testing Scenarios

### Manual Testing
1. Create test league with low salary cap ($50M)
2. Draft expensive players early
3. Verify cap-out detection
4. Confirm draft completion

### Automated Tests
```sql
-- Check cap calculation
SELECT 
  ft.team_name,
  SUM(p.salary_2025_26) as total_salary,
  l.salary_cap_amount,
  (l.salary_cap_amount - SUM(p.salary_2025_26)) as remaining_cap
FROM fantasy_teams ft
JOIN fantasy_team_rosters ftr ON ftr.fantasy_team_id = ft.id
JOIN players p ON p.id = ftr.player_id
JOIN leagues l ON l.id = ft.league_id
WHERE ft.league_id = '{test_league_id}'
GROUP BY ft.team_name, l.salary_cap_amount;
```

## Deployment

### Steps to Deploy
1. Update draft-manager function code
2. Deploy to Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy draft-manager
   ```
3. Verify deployment in Supabase dashboard
4. Monitor logs during next draft

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous draft-manager version
2. Manually complete affected drafts
3. Review logs for root cause
4. Fix and redeploy

## Documentation

### For League Commissioners
- Explain cap-out rules in league settings
- Provide cap management tips
- Set expectations for incomplete rosters

### For Players

- Cap management best practices
- Understanding skipped picks

## Summary

This system ensures:
