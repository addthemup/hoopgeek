# Transactions Page Implementation

## Summary
Added a new Transactions page with trending analytics and renamed "Activity" to "Transactions" in the league navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. LeagueNavigation.tsx
- ✅ Renamed "Activity" tab to "Transactions"
- Updated from `id: 'activity'` to `id: 'transactions'`

### 2. LeagueHome.tsx
- ✅ Reduced recent transactions from 10 to 5
- ✅ Added `onNavigateToTransactions` prop
- ✅ Added "View All Transactions" button that calls `onNavigateToTransactions()`
- This button should navigate to the Transactions tab

### 3. New Transactions.tsx Component
- ✅ Created new full transactions page at `/src/pages/Transactions.tsx`
- **Left Column (8/12)**: Full list of all transactions with detailed player/pick info
- **Right Column (4/12)**: Analytics modules including:
  - **Trending Players**: Top 5 trending players with ownership % and add %
  - **Weekly Activity Chart**: Line chart showing adds/drops over the week
  - **Position Trends**: Bar chart showing adds/drops by position
  - **League Insights**: Hot takes and statistics cards

## Features Implemented

### Transactions Table
- Shows all accepted trades from the league
- Clickable player names that navigate to player pages
- Two-column layout showing what each team sends
- Trade timestamp and status
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

### Trending Modules (Mock Data)
- **Trending Players**: 
  - Player avatars with headshots
  - Ownership percentage
  - Add percentage with trend indicators
  - Position and team info

- **Weekly Activity Chart**:
  - MUI X Charts LineChart
  - Shows adds (green) and drops (red) over 7 days
  - Responsive and interactive

- **Position Trends**:
  - MUI X Charts BarChart
  - Compares adds vs drops by position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C)
  - Grouped bar chart

- **League Insights**:
  - Three colored insight cards
  - Most active day
  - Position spotlight
  - Trade activity count

## Still Need To Do

### Wire Up the Route
In the League.tsx component (or wherever league tabs are handled), add the transactions case:

```typescript
case 'transactions':
  return <Transactions leagueId={leagueId} />;
```

### Pass Navigation Handler to LeagueHome
When rendering LeagueHome, pass the navigation handler:

```typescript
<LeagueHome 
  leagueId={leagueId} 
  onTeamClick={handleTeamClick}
  onNavigateToTransactions={() => setActiveTab('transactions')} // or whatever method changes tabs
/>
```

### Import Transactions Component
Add to the imports in League.tsx:

```typescript
import Transactions from './Transactions';
```

## Dependencies Added
- `@mui/x-charts` for LineChart and BarChart components
- Already using `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching

## Mock Data Structure

### Trending Players
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  position: string;
  team: string;
  ownership: number;
  addedPercent: number;
  droppedPercent: number;
  trend: 'up' | 'down';
  imageId: number;
}
```

### Activity Data
```typescript
{
  days: string[]; // ['Mon', 'Tue', ...]
  adds: number[]; // [45, 52, 38, ...]
  drops: number[]; // [38, 45, 42, ...]
}
```

### Position Trends
```typescript
{
  position: string; // 'PG', 'SG', etc.
  added: number;
  dropped: number;
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- Replace mock data with real league data
- Add date range filters
- Add transaction type filters (trades, adds, drops)
- Add search functionality
- Add export to CSV
- Add more analytics (most active teams, hot/cold streaks, etc.)
- Add player comparison tools

## Notes
- The page is fully responsive with Grid layout
- Charts are lightweight and performant with MUI X Charts
- All player links are clickable and navigate correctly
- Trade data fetching is optimized with batch queries
- Auto-refresh keeps data current
