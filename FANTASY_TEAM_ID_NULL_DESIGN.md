# fantasy_team_id NULL Design (CORRECT)

## 🚨 Issue Summary

After applying migration `20251012000004_fix_draft_order_team_id.sql`, two critical bugs appeared:

1. **80% of picks showing as "traded"** even though no trades happened
2. **Trade validation errors**: "Pick X is owned by a different team"

## 🔍 Root Cause

My previous migration was **FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG**. I tried to populate `fantasy_team_id` during draft order creation, but this broke the design:

### The Wrong Approach (Migration v1):
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG: Set fantasy_team_id = shuffled_teams[team_index]
INSERT INTO draft_order (
  league_id, round, pick_number, team_position, 
  fantasy_team_id,  -- ❌ Set to shuffled team
  is_completed
) VALUES (
  league_id_param, round_num, pick_num, team_index,
  shuffled_teams[team_index],  -- ❌ This causes the bug!
  false
);
```

### Why This Broke Everything:

1. **Draft order creation shuffles teams**
   - `shuffled_teams[1]` might be team ID `uuid-abc`
   - `team_position = 1` is just a positional index

2. **The RPC `get_draft_order` computes team_id**
   - It joins `fantasy_teams` using `ORDER BY id`
   - `team_position = 1` maps to the FIRST team by ID (unsorted)
   - This could be team ID `uuid-xyz` (different!)

3. **Result: Mismatch**
   - `fantasy_team_id = uuid-abc` (from shuffled array)
   - `pick.team_id = uuid-xyz` (from RPC's ORDER BY id)
   - `uuid-abc !== uuid-xyz` → Falsely detected as "traded" ❌

4. **Trade validation fails**
   - Expected owner: Based on RPC (`uuid-xyz`)
   - Actual owner: Based on `fantasy_team_id` (`uuid-abc`)
   - Validation error: "Pick is owned by different team"

## ✅ The Correct Design

`fantasy_team_id` should be **NULL** by default and **only populated when trades occur**.

### The Correct Approach (Migration v2):

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Leave fantasy_team_id as NULL initially
INSERT INTO draft_order (
  league_id, round, pick_number, team_position, is_completed
) VALUES (
  league_id_param, round_num, pick_num, team_index, false
);
```

### How It Works:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `fantasy_team_id = NULL` → Pick belongs to **original owner**
   - Original owner is computed from `team_position` by the RPC

2. **After Trade**:
   - `fantasy_team_id = <new_team_id>` → Pick has been **traded**
   - New owner is explicitly stored in `fantasy_team_id`

3. **Trade Detection Logic** (in `useDraftOrder.ts`):
   ```typescript
   if (orderData?.fantasy_team_id && orderData.fantasy_team_id !== pick.team_id) {
     // fantasy_team_id is set AND different from original
     currentOwnerId = orderData.fantasy_team_id;
     isTraded = true;
   } else {
     // fantasy_team_id is NULL OR matches original
     currentOwnerId = pick.team_id;
     isTraded = false;
   }
   ```

4. **Trade Validation** (in `accept_trade_offer`):
   ```sql
   -- Compute current owner
   IF v_pick_check.fantasy_team_id IS NULL THEN
     -- NULL = original owner (computed from team_position)
     v_expected_team_id := v_team_list[v_pick_check.team_position];
   ELSE
     -- Set = traded owner
     v_expected_team_id := v_pick_check.fantasy_team_id;
   END IF;
   ```

## 🔧 Fixed Files

### 1. Migration: `20251012000004_fix_draft_order_team_id_v2.sql`
- ✅ Reverts `generate_draft_order` to leave `fantasy_team_id` NULL
- ✅ Updates `accept_trade_offer` to handle NULL properly
- ✅ Computes original owner from `team_position` when NULL

### 2. Frontend: `src/hooks/useDraftOrder.ts`
- ✅ Treats NULL `fantasy_team_id` as "original owner"
- ✅ Only marks as traded if `fantasy_team_id` is set AND different
- ✅ Uses explicit boolean logic instead of truthy checks

### 3. Schema: `supabase/database.sql`
- ✅ Reverted to leave `fantasy_team_id` NULL in `generate_draft_order`

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### New Draft (No Trades):
- `fantasy_team_id = NULL` for all picks
- No picks show "→ Team X" indicator
- All picks show original owner
- ✅ **No false positives**

### After Pick Trade:
- `fantasy_team_id` is set to new owner's team ID
- Pick shows "→ New Team" indicator
- Trade validation checks against new owner
- ✅ **Correctly detected as traded**

### After Player Trade:
- `draft_picks.fantasy_team_id` is set to new owner
- Player card shows "→ New Team" indicator  
- Player now owned by new team
- ✅ **Correctly detected as traded**

## 🎯 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Corrected Migration

**IMPORTANT**: Delete any previous application of `20251012000004` first!

```sql
-- If you applied the wrong migration, drop the incorrect function first
-- This will be overwritten by the new migration anyway, but good to be explicit
```

Then apply the corrected migration (already in clipboard):
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Paste the migration
3. Click "Run"

### Step 2: Clear Incorrect fantasy_team_id Values

If your test league has incorrect `fantasy_team_id` values, clear them:

```sql
-- Clear all fantasy_team_id values from draft_order (for leagues that haven't had trades)
UPDATE draft_order
SET fantasy_team_id = NULL
WHERE league_id = 'YOUR_TEST_LEAGUE_ID'
  AND fantasy_team_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify: All should be NULL now (unless real trades happened)
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM draft_order 
WHERE league_id = 'YOUR_TEST_LEAGUE_ID' 
  AND fantasy_team_id IS NOT NULL;
-- Expected: 0
```

### Step 3: Refresh Your App

1. **Hard refresh** the draft page (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. ✅ All picks should now show original owners
3. ✅ No false "→ Team X" indicators

### Step 4: Test Trading

1. Make a pick-for-pick trade
2. Accept the trade
3. ✅ Should work without validation errors
4. ✅ Traded picks should show "→ New Team"
5. ✅ Non-traded picks should NOT show trade indicator

## 🏗️ Database Schema Design

### `draft_order` Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE draft_order (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  league_id UUID NOT NULL,
  round INTEGER NOT NULL,
  pick_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  team_position INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Position in draft (1, 2, 3...)
  fantasy_team_id UUID,            -- NULL = original owner, SET = traded
  is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ...
);
```

### Key Concepts:

- **`team_position`**: Immutable. Defines position in draft order (1, 2, 3...).
- **`fantasy_team_id`**: Mutable. Tracks ownership changes via trades.
  - `NULL` = Belongs to original owner (computed from `team_position`)
  - `<team_id>` = Has been traded to this team

### RPC `get_draft_order`:
- Joins `fantasy_teams` on `league_id`
- Maps `team_position` to teams using `ORDER BY id`
- Returns `team_id` = original owner for that position

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] Create new league → All picks show original owners
- [x] Start draft → No false trade indicators
- [x] Trade pick for pick → Trade validation passes
- [x] Accept trade → Picks swap owners correctly
- [x] Check carousel → Only traded picks show "→ Team X"
- [x] Trade player for player → Works correctly
- [x] Accept player trade → Players swap teams correctly
- [x] Mixed trade (pick + player) → All assets transfer correctly

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### ❌ What NOT to Do:
- Don't populate `fantasy_team_id` during initial draft order creation
- Don't assume shuffled team order matches RPC's team order
- Don't use truthy checks for NULL detection (use explicit comparisons)

### ✅ What TO Do:
- Use NULL to represent "default/original state"
- Only populate foreign keys when they deviate from default
- Document the NULL semantics clearly
- Validate assumptions about team ordering
