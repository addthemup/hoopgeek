# 🎉 League Invite System - Reactivated & Fixed

## Overview

The league invite system has been fully reactivated and updated to work with `hoop-geek.com`. Users can now share a single invite URL, and the first N people who sign up and join will automatically be assigned to available team slots.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Missing Database Functions Created**
   - `get_league_by_invite_code()` - Public function to retrieve league info by invite code
   - `join_league_via_invite()` - Assigns user to first available team (where `user_id IS NULL`)

### 2. **First-Come, First-Served System**
   - One invite URL works for multiple people
   - System automatically finds the first team with `user_id = NULL`
   - Assigns the joining user to that team
   - Auto-creates 15 roster spots for the new team member

### 3. **Production URL Updated**
   - Changed from showing local URLs to `https://hoop-geek.com/join/{inviteCode}`
   - Development mode still uses `localhost` for testing
   - Same URL works in email shares and copy-to-clipboard

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Step 1: League Creation**
1. Commissioner creates a league with max teams (e.g., 20 teams)
2. System generates a unique 6-character invite code (e.g., `A3X7F9`)
3. System creates placeholder teams:
   - 1 team assigned to commissioner (has `user_id`)
   - 19 teams unassigned (`user_id = NULL`)

### **Step 2: Invite Distribution**
Commissioner shares the invite URL:
```
https://hoop-geek.com/join/A3X7F9
```

They can share it via:
- Copy & paste
- Email (pre-filled template)
- Any messaging platform

### **Step 3: User Joins**
1. User clicks the invite link → Taken to `/join/A3X7F9`
2. Page shows league name and available spots
3. If not logged in: **"Sign in with Google"** button
4. After login: Option to enter custom team name or use auto-generated name
5. User clicks **"Join League"**

### **Step 4: Team Assignment**
The `join_league_via_invite()` function:

```sql
-- Finds first available team (user_id IS NULL)
SELECT id, team_name, season_id
FROM fantasy_teams
WHERE league_id = {league_id}
AND user_id IS NULL
AND is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY created_at ASC  -- First-come, first-served
LIMIT 1;

-- Assigns the user
UPDATE fantasy_teams
SET 
    user_id = {new_user_id},
    team_name = {custom_name_or_default},
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = {first_available_team};

-- Creates 15 roster spots
INSERT INTO fantasy_roster_spots ...
```

### **Step 5: Multiple Users**
- 1st user gets Team 2 (first NULL team)
- 2nd user gets Team 3
- 3rd user gets Team 4
- ...and so on until league is full
