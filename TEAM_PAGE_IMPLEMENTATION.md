## 🚀 Next Steps (For Future Implementation)

### Phase 1: Database Schema
1. Create `team_transactions` table
2. Create `trading_block` table
3. Create `team_draft_picks` table (future picks ownership)
4. Create `weekly_matchups` table
5. Create `team_performance_stats` table

### Phase 2: API Hooks
1. `useTeamTransactions(teamId)`
2. `useTradingBlock(teamId)`
3. `useTeamFuturePicks(teamId)`
4. `useWeeklyMatchup(teamId, weekNumber)`
5. `useTeamPerformanceStats(teamId)`

### Phase 3: Real Data Integration
1. Replace placeholder data in each module
2. Add real opponent team data to basketball court matchup
3. Implement weekly lineup selection
4. Connect to NBA API for live player jersey numbers
5. Add interactive features (click to trade, click player for details, etc.)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Export/share lineup images to social media
2. Animated jersey transitions
3. Real-time matchup score updates
4. Historical matchup viewer
5. Performance trend charts
