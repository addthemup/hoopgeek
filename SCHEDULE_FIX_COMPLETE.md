# Schedule Generator Fix - Complete Summary

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dates Now Match `fantasy_season_weeks`**
- ‚úÖ Schedule generator now queries `fantasy_season_weeks` table for accurate date ranges
- ‚úÖ No more manual date calculations
- ‚úÖ Preseason shows Oct 2-20 (correct)
- ‚úÖ Week 1 shows Oct 21-26 (correct)
- ‚úÖ All subsequent weeks match database

### 2. **Playoff Weeks Are Now Correct**
- ‚úÖ 3-week playoff = **Weeks 23, 24, 25** (last 3 weeks)
- ‚úÖ 2-week playoff = **Weeks 24, 25** (last 2 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Formula: `playoff_start_week = 25 - playoff_weeks + 1`
- ‚úÖ Regular season fills weeks 1 through (playoff_start_week - 1)

### 3. **Proper Round-Robin Rotation**
- ‚úÖ Teams no longer play same opponent every week
- ‚úÖ Uses Circle Method algorithm for fair rotation
- ‚úÖ Every team plays every other team over the season

### 4. **Preseason Week 0 Generated**
- ‚úÖ Preseason matchups created with `is_preseason = true`
- ‚úÖ Random pairings for practice games
- ‚úÖ Shows "Preseason (Practice)" badge in UI
- ‚úÖ Does NOT count in standings

## üìÅ Files Changed

### Database Migrations

1. **`supabase/migrations/20251012000008_add_is_preseason_column.sql`**
   ```sql
   -- Adds is_preseason column to weekly_matchups
   ALTER TABLE weekly_matchups ADD COLUMN is_preseason BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
   ```

2. **`supabase/migrations/20251012000009_fix_schedule_generator.sql`**
   ```sql
   -- Rewrites generate_league_schedule() to:
   -- 1. Use fantasy_season_weeks for dates
   -- 2. Calculate playoff weeks correctly (last N weeks)
   -- 3. Implement round-robin rotation
   -- 4. Generate preseason matchups
   ```

3. **`supabase/database.sql`** (Updated)
   - Changed function call signature
   - Now passes `season_year` instead of `season_start_date`

### Frontend Files

4. **`src/hooks/useTeamSchedule.ts`** (Updated)
   - Joins with `fantasy_season_weeks` for accurate dates
   - Fetches `is_preseason` flag
   - Returns proper week names and date ranges
   - Checks for division games

5. **`src/components/TeamSchedule.tsx`** (Updated)
   - Displays preseason games with "Preseason (Practice)" badge
   - Color-codes preseason as warning (yellow)
   - Handles preseason flag in type checking

## üìä How It Works Now

### Schedule Generation Logic

```typescript
// For 3-week playoff:
const total_weeks = 25;
const playoff_weeks = 3;
const playoff_start_week = 25 - 3 + 1 = 23;
const regular_season_weeks = 23 - 1 = 22;

// Results:
// Week 0: Preseason (practice)
// Weeks 1-22: Regular season
// Weeks 23-25: Playoffs
```

### Date Assignment

```sql
-- Old way (WRONG):
matchup_date := season_start_date + (week_num - 1) * INTERVAL '7 days';

-- New way (CORRECT):
SELECT start_date, end_date INTO week_record
FROM fantasy_season_weeks
WHERE season_year = 2025 AND week_number = week_num;

INSERT INTO weekly_matchups (matchup_date, ...)
VALUES (week_record.start_date, ...);
```

### Round-Robin Rotation

```
Week 1: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Matchups: 1v10, 2v9, 3v8, 4v7, 5v6

Week 2: [1,10,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] (rotated)
Matchups: 1v9, 10v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5

Week 3: [1,9,10,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] (rotated)
Matchups: 1v8, 9v7, 10v6, 2v5, 3v4
```

## üöÄ How to Apply

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

```bash
cd /Users/adam/Desktop/hoopgeek

# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Manual via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Run 20251012000008_add_is_preseason_column.sql
# 3. Run 20251012000009_fix_schedule_generator.sql
```

### Step 2: Test with New League

```bash
# 1. Create a new test league
# 2. Set playoff_weeks to 3
# 3. Check the schedule:
```

```sql
-- Verify schedule is correct
SELECT 
  wm.week_number,
  fsw.week_name,
  fsw.start_date,
  fsw.end_date,
  wm.season_type,
  wm.is_preseason,
  ft1.team_name as team1,
  ft2.team_name as team2
FROM weekly_matchups wm
JOIN fantasy_season_weeks fsw ON fsw.week_number = wm.week_number AND fsw.season_year = wm.season_year
JOIN fantasy_teams ft1 ON wm.fantasy_team1_id = ft1.id
JOIN fantasy_teams ft2 ON wm.fantasy_team2_id = ft2.id
WHERE wm.league_id = 'YOUR_LEAGUE_ID'
ORDER BY wm.week_number;
```

### Step 3: Verify Frontend

1. Navigate to Team Schedule page
2. Check Week 0 shows "Preseason (Practice)" badge
3. Check dates match fantasy_season_weeks:
   - Week 0: Oct 2-20
   - Week 1: Oct 21-26
   - Week 2: Oct 27 - Nov 2
   - etc.
4. Check playoff weeks are 23, 24, 25 (for 3-week playoff)
