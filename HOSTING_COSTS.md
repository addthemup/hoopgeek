**Good for:** 10k-500k monthly visitors

---

### Phase 3: Scale (Custom)
**Total: ~$200-500/month**

- Vercel Enterprise or higher Pro tier
- Supabase Pro + add-ons
- CDN optimization
- Monitoring & analytics
- Support contracts

**Good for:** 500k+ monthly visitors

---

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Upgrade

### Upgrade Vercel ($0 â†’ $20/mo) when:
- âœ… You hit 80GB bandwidth/month (~40k visitors)
- âœ… You want to monetize (commercial use)
- âœ… You need advanced analytics
- âœ… You need faster build times

### Upgrade Supabase ($0 â†’ $25/mo) when:
- âœ… Database > 400MB
- âœ… You have >100 active users
- âœ… You need daily backups
- âœ… Project pausing becomes annoying (free tier pauses after 7 days)
- âœ… You launch publicly

---

## ðŸ’¡ Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Use Cloudflare R2 for Large Assets
**Problem:** 15GB of game JSON files  
**Solution:** Store on Cloudflare R2, serve via CDN  
**Cost:** $0.015/GB/month storage + $0 egress = **$0.23/month**

```bash
# Upload to R2
# Reference URLs in your app
# Infinite free bandwidth!
```

### 2. Optimize Images
- Use WebP format
- Lazy loading with `loading="lazy"`
- Responsive images with `srcset`
- Team logos: ~10KB each instead of 100KB

### 3. Code Splitting (Already Set Up!)
- Vendor chunks separated
- Only load what's needed
- Smaller initial bundle

### 4. Caching Strategy
- Static assets: 1 year cache
- API responses: Short cache
- Game JSONs: Long cache
- User data: No cache
